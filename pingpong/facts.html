			<h3>Fact №1</h3>
			<p>The second name, "ping pong," appeared relatively recently, in 1901. The reason is very simple: it's the sound that the ball makes when it hits the racket and then the table surface.</p>
			<p>The first official competition was the London Championship, which took place at the end of 1900 on the territory of Westminster Abbey. The tournament was a clear confirmation of the game's popularity, with approximately 300 players participating.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-2">
			<h3>Fact №2</h3>
			<p>Medieval paintings depicting a game resembling modern table tennis have been preserved on the walls of the Imperial Chinese Summer Palace.</p>
			<p>In a standard five-set match, a player covers an average distance of approximately 4-7 kilometers. That's why even this tabletop game can be considered a significant cardiovascular workout. During an intense game, a player may sometimes expend more energy than in basketball.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-3">
			<h3>Fact №3</h3>
			<p>The ball speed in table tennis can reach up to 170 km/h, and the spin can reach up to 170 rotations per second.</p>
			<p>The most decorated male player in table tennis history is Viktor Barna, who has won 15 world championship titles. The most renowned female athlete is Maria Mednyanszky, with 12 world championship titles to her name.</p>

			<h3>Fact №4</h3>
			<p>The longest recorded table tennis match occurred in the USA in 1979 and lasted for 101 hours, 1 minute, and 1 second. The longest singles match between individual players lasted for 143 hours and 46 minutes.</p>
			<p>The USA saw another impressive record in 1983 when two amateurs, Rick Baulig and Richard de Witt, engaged in a non-stop table tennis rally. They managed to keep the ball going without a single mistake for an astounding duration of 10 hours and 9 minutes. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Fact №5</h3>
			<p>
			The record holders for the most appearances in the Summer Olympic Games are Jörgen Persson, Jean-Michel Saive, and Zoran Primorac, each having participated in the Games seven times.</p>
			<p>In 1958, an 8-year-old tennis player named Jay Foster won the national championship of Jamaica.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Fact №6</h3>
			<p>The most famous European champion in table tennis is Jan-Ove Waldner, who earned the nickname "The Mozart of Table Tennis." He started playing the sport at the age of 6, and by the age of 9, he became the Swedish champion in his category.</p>
			<p>
				Table tennis is not only fun and interesting but also offers several real-life benefits through regular practice:

				Eyesight Improvement: Table tennis is an excellent exercise for people with nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) and can aid in rehabilitation after surgical procedures. During training, the eyes constantly focus on the moving ball, which can be more effective than regular eye exercises. It also serves as good prevention for those who spend long hours working on computers.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Fact №7</h3>
			<p>Reaction. Table tennis excellently develops reaction, concentration, agility, flexibility, and hand-eye coordination. Such training is included in the program of athletes whose field is not related to tennis at all. For example, it was part of the training program for boxer Vitali Klitschko.</p>
			<p>
			Cardio. Active and dynamic gameplay strengthens the cardiovascular system, as well as the respiratory system and leg muscles. Additionally, table tennis improves endurance, promotes the development of fine motor skills, and trains the wrists and hands.</p>
